# Route Editor application

This application allows you to interactively create a route on the map, indicating the start, end and intermediate points of movement.

The application was implemented using React. Redux is connected to store state.


The application implements the drag and drop of items that were declared to the list, this is done using the react-sortable-hoc library, and the map implementation using react-yandex-maps
